# Regularization-and-dropout-in-Deep-learning



Regularization and dropout are techniques used in deep learning to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization capability of neural networks.

Regularization is a process of adding a penalty term to the loss function during training. The penalty term encourages the network to have smaller weights, thereby reducing the complexity of the model. The two most common regularization techniques in deep learning are L1 regularization and L2 regularization:

1. L1 Regularization (Lasso regularization): It adds a penalty term proportional to the sum of absolute values of the weights. This encourages sparsity in the network by pushing some of the weights to exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection.

2. L2 Regularization (Ridge regularization): It adds a penalty term proportional to the sum of squared weights. L2 regularization encourages smaller weights overall without driving them to zero, which helps in preventing overfitting and controlling the magnitudes of the weights.

Regularization techniques help prevent the model from memorizing the training data and promote learning of more generalizable patterns.

Dropout is a regularization technique specifically designed for neural networks. During training, dropout randomly sets a fraction of the activations (outputs) of the neurons to zero. This means that those neurons are effectively "dropped out" for that particular training iteration. By doing so, dropout prevents co-adaptation of neurons and reduces the reliance of the network on any individual neuron. This helps in preventing overfitting and encourages the network to learn more robust and generalizable features.

During testing or inference, dropout is usually turned off, and the entire network is used for prediction. However, the weights of the neurons are typically scaled by the dropout probability to compensate for the activations that were dropped during training.

Both regularization and dropout are valuable techniques in deep learning to improve the generalization performance of neural networks and combat overfitting. They promote the development of models that perform well on unseen data and help achieve better accuracy and reliability.
